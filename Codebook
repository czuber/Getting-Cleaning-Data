## https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================
README.txt: Description file with the details of all the files in dowload
features_info.txt: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
features.txt: List of all features.
activity_labels.txt: Links the class labels with their activity name
train/X_train.txt': Training set.
train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
test/X_test.txt': Test set.
test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

Transformations
Change column names of x_train to names listed in features
Change column names of y_train" to ActivityID"
Change column names of subject_train to "SubjectID"
Change column names of x_test to names listed in features
Change column names of y_test to "ActivityID"
Change column names of subject_test to "SubjectID"
Change column names of activity_labels to ('ActivityID','ActivityType')

Bind columns of y_train, x_train, and subject_train together
Bind columns of y_test, x_test, and subject_test together
Bind rows of the previous two results together

Subset columns to only include SubjectID, ActivityID and all columns that contain either "mean" or "std"

Change 'GyroJerk' to "AngularAcceleration" in all column names
Change 'Gyro' to "Gyroscope" in all column names
Change 'Mag' to "Magnitude" in all column names
Change '^t' to "Time" in all column names
Change '^f' to "Frequency" in all column names
Change 'mean(' to ".Mean" in all column names
Change 'std(' to ".StandardDeviation" in all column names
Change 'Freq\\.' to "Frequency." in all column names
Change 'Freq$' to "Frequency" in all column names
Change "[][!#$%(*,.:;<=>@^_`|~.{}]" to "" in all column names

Join Activity Labels to final data set
Remove ActivityID
Group by SubjectID and ActivityType
Remove NAs
Calculate the mean for all columns by SubjectID and ActivityType
Order by SubjectID and ActivityType

Write results to csv file
