# Getting-Cleaning-Data
## run_analysis.R Scipt
* Used to pull Zip file from the web that contains the UCI HAR Dataset
* Transformations are then made to be able to take the mean of all Mean and Standard Deviation Records by the SubjectID and ActivityType

## Running run_analysis.R
* Please ensure that you have the following packages installed:
  ** dplyr
* In order to run the script you will need to ensure that you have changed the directory to match an existing folder on your local machine

## Project Assignment
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
